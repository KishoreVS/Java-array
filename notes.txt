BOOTSTARP:
============


INTTRODUCTION:
---------------
** BOOTSTARP IS A  FREE,OPENSOURCE AND IS THE MOST POUPULAR HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT FRAMEWORK DEVELOPED BY
TWITTER FOR CREATING RESPONSIVE WEB APPLICATIONS.

-->IT INCLUDES HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT BASED TEMPLATES 


**ADVANTAGES OF BOOTSTARP:
===========================

1) BOOTSTARP SUPPROTS RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN.(FASTER AND EASIER).

WHAT IS RESPONSIVE WEB APPLICATIONS

* RESPONSIVE WEB APPLICATIONS AUTOMATICALLY ADOPTS SCREEN SIZE.(DESKTOP,LAPTOP,MOBILES,TABLETS..ETC)
(IT PROVIEDS INTERACTION EXPERIANCE(EASY READING AND NAVIGATION)).

Example(RWD):
===========
http://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.0.3/docs/examples/jumbotron/

2)saves lot of development time.(instead writing the code,it offers ready made block of code)


3)consistency

4)customizable

HOW TO CREATE PAGE LAYOUTS USING BOOTSTRAP GRID SYSTEM:-
=======================================================


* BOOTSTARP GRID SYSTEM IS USED FOR CREATING PAGE LAYOUTS THROUGH  A SERIES OF ROWS AND COLUMNS,
THE GRID SYSTEM CONSISTS OF 12 COLUMNS. 


HOW TO CREATE 3 COLUMN LAYOUT USING THE BOOTSTARP GRID SYSTEM?

*THE THREE COLUMN LAYOUT THE PAGE SHOULD BE DEVIDED INTO THREE COLUMNS WITH 1:4:1 RATIO.

*IT SHOULD GIVE 12 UNITS IF WE CALUCULATE  LIKE 2 UNITS+4 UNITS+2 UNITS.


*BOOTSTRAP INCLUDED SEVERAL GRID CLASSES FOR CREATING LAYOUTS FOR DIFFERENT DEVICES LIKE MOBILE,PC LAPTOP


 BOOTSTRAP GRID CLASSES:-
 =======================
	DEVICE      									BOOTSTRAP CLASS

 1)EXTRA SMALL DEVICES-->MOBILE PHONES(<768PX) 		.col-*
 
 2)SMALL DEVICES-->TABLETS(>=768PX) 				.col-sm-*
 
 
 3)MEDIAM DEVICES-->laptops(>=992PX) 				.col-md-*
 
 
 4)LARGE DEVICES-->pc(>=1200PX)	 					.col-lg-*
 
 
 4)EXTRA LARGE DEVICES-->pc(>=1200PX)	 			.col-xl-*
 

 .col- (extra small devices - screen width less than 576px)
.col-sm- (small devices - screen width equal to or greater than 576px)
.col-md- (medium devices - screen width equal to or greater than 768px)
.col-lg- (large devices - screen width equal to or greater than 992px)
.col-xl- (xlarge devices - screen width equal to or greater than 1200px)
 
 
 

*  indicates  no of units

Rules:
======
**	rows must be in container for proper alignment,padding

**	we used row to create horizantal group of columns.

 **and columns should be child to the rows.
 
 if sum is beyond 12 it will be like new row..(for single row 12 units)
 
 
 **if we want create 4 equal columns i.e 1:1:1:1 ratio
